# CM Homework - Flutter

## Description

This Flutter based application provides a concept for a community collaboration platform for bicycle users. The main navigation is based on tabs. It uses OSM Flutter to display a map with the points of interest and the user location. It is possible to click on a point of interest on the map to view its details. There are two list views with slidables, which contain points of interest and routes and allow the user to delete or show them on the map (routes are not displayed), but also view their details by clicking them. There is a floating action button to add new points of interest and routes. The state is maintained inside the whole application.
